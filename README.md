Hoard

THis is just a very simple HTTP server with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE capabilities.

It is a proof-of-concept only.

Right now there are some hard-coded settings:

  * It uses a server.crt and server.key to start up TLS
  * Files are created and retrieved from the "data" directory.
  * It listens on 0.0.0.0:9443
